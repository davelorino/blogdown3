<p>Text Analysis is growing in popularity just about everywhere - it’s an abundant source of data that until recently most analysts have ignored because of it’s unwieldy structure. Recent developments and packages in the R programming language have made it easy to derive significant meaning from a text corpus.</p>
<div id="practical-applications-of-text-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Practical Applications of Text Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Analysing email data (e.g. from a customer service inbox to analyze queries and feedback),</li>
<li>Web scraping (e.g. Cambridge Analytica, though always consider the ethical implications of such methods even if the data is publicly available or rightfully yours to share),</li>
<li>Literary analysis (e.g. poems (Shelley vs Byron) and speeches (Obama vs Trump))</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post we’ll look at the Australian Election Speeches 1901 - 2016 dataset provided by <a href="https://electionspeeches.moadoph.gov.au/speeches" class="uri">https://electionspeeches.moadoph.gov.au/speeches</a> - we’ll connect R to their API to read the data, then we’ll clean, analyze and visualize the data with some helpful R packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(jsonlite)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;:
## 
##     filter, lag</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;:
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="connecting-to-the-api" class="section level2">
<h2>Connecting to the API</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>speeches &lt;- fromJSON(&quot;https://electionspeeches.moadoph.gov.au/api/speeches.json&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Call str() on the resulting ‘speeches’ data.frame - i’m not going to print the output here because it’s really large.</p>
<p>Load the stringr package to join the ‘candidate_name’ variable into a ‘Name_Surname’ format instead of ‘Name Surname’ (R just needs things to be a certain way sometimes). and strip the 12th column because it contains a really dense list of metadata that we aren’t using.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(stringr)
speeches$candidate_name &lt;- str_replace(speeches$candidate_name, &quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Convert ‘candidate_name’ from a character variable to a factor variable</p>
<pre class="r"><code>speeches$candidate_name &lt;- as.factor(speeches$candidate_name)</code></pre>
<p>And now let’s remove that twelfth column in our dataset, it’s just a big messy list of metadata that we aren’t even using</p>
<pre class="r"><code>speeches &lt;- speeches[,-12]</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="creating-helper-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating Helper Functions</h2>
<p>Now that our dataset is looking a little tidier, we’ll want to start cleaning that ‘body’ variable because it contains all of the speeches we’ll be analyzing. For our purposes we’ll want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>strip the html embedded into the speeches data</li>
<li>make everything lowercase (otherwise we double up on words)</li>
<li>remove numbers (not always necessary, it will help us now though)</li>
<li>remove punctuation (otherwise “word” and “word,” are treated differently)</li>
<li>remove anything annoying or unhelpful that’s left over</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>cleanFun &lt;- function(htmlString) {
  return(gsub(&quot;&lt;.*?&gt;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, htmlString))
}</code></pre>
<p>Our handy little cleanFun() function will strip 99% of the html from the body. We’ll handle the rest of the html and cleaning with this next function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tm)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: NLP</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>clean_this &lt;- function(x){
       cleanFun(x) %&gt;%
       tolower() %&gt;%
       tm::removeNumbers() %&gt;% 
       tm::removePunctuation() -&gt; yy 
       (gsub(&quot;\\\n&quot;, &quot; &quot;, yy))
}</code></pre>
<p>Ok now let’s use it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>speeches2 &lt;- clean_this(speeches$body)</code></pre>
<p>Our text data should look a lot cleaner now… let’s take a look.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(speeches2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  chr [1:90] &quot; compliment of hunter mainland invitation faithful representation of their australian interests great honor to &quot;| __truncated__ ...</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="tokens-and-bigrams" class="section level2">
<h2>Tokens and Bigrams</h2>
<p>Cool, now that we’ve cleaned our speeches we can start to analyze visualize them. Let’s look at word pairs first.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidytext)
library(tidyr)

single_tokens &lt;- speeches %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = body) %&gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;%
  count(word) %&gt;%
  rename(value = n)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Joining, by = &quot;word&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>body_bigrams2 &lt;- speeches %&gt;%
     unnest_tokens(bigram, body, token = &quot;ngrams&quot;, n = 2) %&gt;%
     separate(bigram, c(&quot;from&quot;, &quot;to&quot;), sep = &quot; &quot;) %&gt;%
     filter(!from %in% stop_words$word) %&gt;%
     filter(!to %in% stop_words$word) %&gt;%
     count(from, to, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%
     rename(size = n) %&gt;%
     filter(size &gt;= 10)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="visualize-the-word-pairs" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualize the Word Pairs</h2>
<p>Let’s use our ngram and bigram data to make an interactive network graph of all of the most common word pairs in the history of Australian election speeches.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggraph)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: ggplot2</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

<pre class="r"><code>library(DT)

                        label = unique(c(body_bigrams2$from, body_bigrams2$to))) %&gt;%
                left_join(single_tokens, by = c(id = &quot;word&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Last step! Let’s visualize the network…</p>
